## Architecture
This project is built using React and Material UI using [Open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/) API to fetch weather data. The data
is displayed using React. Components are the building blocks of the UI where we have four primary components being used, which are 
```Search, ForecastDisplay, WeatherDisplay and Title```

##Search
This is a react component that displays a textfield and allows the user to input a city or country so as to query the api and return that data.
##ForecastDisplay
This component displays weekly data from the weather api for 5 days to come which is what the free-tier package of the OpenWeatherApi provides.
##WeatherDisplay
This componet displays the current weather of the city or country that was queried from the search bar
##Title
This is a simple component displaying the title of the project 

It have some cool features like save the weather data in redux-store and session-storage to reduce the dependency of network requests, search weather details according to the city, detect your current location for displaying weather data, shows a map of that location, sync data to get the latest updated details of the current weather, toast notification for every action, pop up modal to display extra details of seven-day forecast weather, cool zoom-in zoom-out animations and responsive for every screen size.

To use the app, type a name of the city and click on search/press Enter or else click on the Your location weather button, every time you click on the button first it will check if the data is available in the session storage or not, and if not then it will send a network request else it will take the data from session-storage.
